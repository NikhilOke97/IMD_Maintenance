# IMD_Maintenance
The project present aspects regarding importance of using cloud com puting technology for data processing of the data from IMD Station In charges. The IMD stations are used for monitoring application via variety of sensors. There are some limitations in terms of memory, energy, compu tation, communication, scalability and eﬃcient management of the sensors from time to time from IMD Stations. The cloud computing is needed for powerful and scalable high-performance computing and massive storage infrastructure for real-time processing which will be used for storing IMD maintenance data from diﬀerent stations. The chatbot will be used for assistance, reminder, data retrieve and etc. The oﬃcials can interact with operators , the data must be stored by using cloud computing technology because this allow computing, storage and software services (SaaS) with customization possibilities and virtualization at low cost. The Cloud Com puting can provide an open, ﬂexible, and reconﬁgurable platform (PaaS) for monitoring and controlling maintenance applications.
